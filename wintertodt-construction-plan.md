### Key Gaps to Close

- Woodcutting 50 -> 60 (need ~50k more XP, roughly 2,500 oaks)
- Construction 1 -> 8 free via Daddy's Home, then grind to 70
- Firemaking 50 -> 85+ via Wintertodt

---

## Phase 1: The Setup

### 1a. Daddy's Home Mini-Quest

Speak to **Marlo** in northeast Varrock (near the Sawmill). This is a short mini-quest, no combat.

**Rewards:**
- Instant Construction level 8
- House unlocked in Rimmington
- Free building materials (planks, nails, etc.)
- Saves massive early grind

### 1b. Woodcutting Grind to 60

**Location:** Seers' Village -- oak trees directly behind the bank.

- Chop oaks from level 50 to 60
- **Bank every single log.** Do not drop or burn.
- Target: ~4,600 oak logs banked total (you'll use these later for planks)
- At level 50 with a rune axe, expect ~250-300 oaks/hr
- Estimated time: ~15-17 hours

> Level 60 Woodcutting is the minimum for Wintertodt root chopping to be efficient. Below 60 you'll get noticeably fewer roots per game.

### 1c. Early Construction Training (to Level 20)

1. Withdraw ~200 oak logs + GP from bank
2. Run to **Varrock Sawmill** (northeast Varrock)
3. Convert oak logs to oak planks (250gp each = 50k for 200 planks)
4. Teleport to house (Rimmington)
5. Build **Oak Chairs** (level 8-19) then **Oak Larders** (level 20+)
6. Target: Level 20 Construction

> Level 20 Con at Wintertodt means better Construction XP from crate rewards. Each level matters here because Wintertodt Construction XP scales with your level.

---

## Phase 2: The Wintertodt Grind

### Gear Checklist

- [ ] Warm clothing (4 pieces) -- Clue Hunter outfit is free from beginner clues
- [ ] Best axe available (rune axe)
- [ ] Hammer
- [ ] Knife
- [ ] Tinderbox
- [ ] Food: cakes (3 bites, no healing wasted at low HP) or wines

### Strategy: Solo Games for Max Points

- **World:** W309 is the dedicated Wintertodt world, but solo on any quiet world works
- **Method:** Light brazier -> chop bruma roots -> fletch into kindling -> feed brazier
- **Target per game:** 13,500 points (max reward rolls per crate)
- **Fletching kindling** is key -- it gives bonus Fletching XP and more points per root

### XP Gains Per Game (~13,500 pts)

| Skill | XP per game (approx) |
|-------|---------------------|
| Firemaking | ~350-400 |
| Woodcutting | ~50-80 |
| Fletching | ~50-80 |
| Construction | Scales with level (huge at 20+) |

### Loot Targets

| Item | Drop Rate | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Tome of Fire** | 1/1000 per roll | ~60% chance by 99 FM. Main goal. |
| **Dragon Axe** | 1/10,000 per roll | Nice bonus, don't expect it |
| GP/seeds/ores | Common | Major ironman income source |
| Warm clothing pieces | Uncommon | Pyromancer outfit for FM XP bonus |

### Stop Conditions

- Firemaking level 85+ (minimum for efficient diary/quest requirements)
- Tome of Fire obtained
- ~1M+ GP banked from crate rewards
- Boredom threshold reached

---

## Phase 3: The Payoff

### 3a. Convert Logs to Planks

- Take remaining ~4,400 banked oak logs to the Sawmill
- Cost: 250gp per plank = ~1.1M GP total
- Fund this with Wintertodt crate GP
- Alternative: use the Plank Make spell (Magic 86) if you've leveled Magic -- saves GP but you probably won't have the level

### 3b. Mahogany Homes

**What:** A Construction minigame that gives ~2.5x more XP per plank than standard POH building.

**How:**
1. Speak to a Mahogany Homes agent in **Falador** or **Varrock**
2. Select **Novice Contracts** (requires oak planks)
3. Travel to the assigned NPC's house, build/repair furniture
4. Return to agent for XP + Carpenter's Points

**XP per oak plank:** ~70 XP (vs ~28 XP for oak larders in POH)

**Expected result:** 4,400 oak planks through Mahogany Homes = ~308k Construction XP

| Starting Level | XP Needed for 70 | Planks Needed (MH) |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| 20 | ~663k | ~9,500 |
| 30 | ~625k | ~8,900 |
| 40 | ~572k | ~8,200 |

> Reality check: 4,400 planks alone won't hit 70. But combined with Wintertodt's passive Construction XP (which is substantial over hundreds of games), you should land around 60-70. Bank more oaks if you want to guarantee 70.

## Notes

- Keep HP low (10) for Wintertodt. At low HP, damage is minimal and cakes/wines are enough. Don't train Hitpoints before this grind.
- Current HP is 21 -- damage will be noticeable. Bring extra food.
- Wintertodt crates scale loot with your skill levels. Low levels = worse loot but that's fine. The GP and seeds are the main value.
- Construction level directly affects Wintertodt Construction XP rewards. Getting to 20 before starting is important.
